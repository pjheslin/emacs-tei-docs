# Emacs-tei-docs

An Emacs browser for the documentation of the Text Encoding Initiative.

## tei-html-docs-p5.el
tei-html-docs-p5.el provides a function that looks up the name of the XML element before the cursor and displays the TEI P5 guidelines for that element. It can get the guidelines from the Internet, or from a local copy. It works very nicely with the emacs-w3m interface to the w3m web-browser, but if you don't have that installed, it will display the guidelines in an external web browser.

## tei-html-docs-p4.el
tei-html-docs-p4.el is just as above, but is an older version for the TEI P4 Guidelines.
